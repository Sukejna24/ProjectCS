Database Installation

You need mysql or mariasql. In order to administre the database we recommend xampp.

1. Install xampp from https://www.apachefriends.org/download.html. Take note of your password.
2. Start mysql and apache with xampp Control Panel by clicking on start next to apache and mysql.
3. Configure in the directory \xampp\phpMyAdmin the file config.inc.php and the lines: $cfg['Servers'][$i]['password'] = 'your password';
4. start the browser and enter: http://localhost and then on the top right line click on phpMyAdmin. You should see the database administration view
5. start a cmd and enter the following: mysql -u root -p data < backup_data.sql
6. enter password in the file dbapi.py on line 9: password = 'your password'
7. start mainStreamlit2.py: streamlit.cmd run .\mainStreamlit2.py

Changes to the database get dumped as follows:
mysqldump -u root -p --databases data > backup_data_20241130.sql
