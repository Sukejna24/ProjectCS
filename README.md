# "Melody-Match" with Spotify 
This is the repository for the FCS Project

This is a description of the Group 7.4, and we will focus on making a website called "Melody-Match". It will use two users music preferences and make a good match from their favorite Music!

Here is how it works:
- We will use Spotify API to gather information from the two users
- We will make a preference list of: genres, artists, song, theme, Language...
- Lastly, there will be a button that mixes all the melodies together with Machine Learning!
